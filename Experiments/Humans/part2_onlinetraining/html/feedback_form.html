      <p>Congratulations! You're done with the main phase.</p>
      <p> Before we proceed with the last phase, we'd like to ask you for some feedback! </p>
      <p>Probably, you came up with a pretty good idea how to solve the task</p>
      <p>As we had mentioned at the beginning of the experiment, your task was to figure out the rules
      that determine which button you'd have to press as response in each garden</p>
      <p> Could you please write down the rules that you used to solve the task in each of the two boxes below? </p>
      <p> Please write the rules you used for the north garden (snowy one) in the first box and for the south garden (desert) in the second box.</p>

      <textarea rows="8" cols="40" id="userNorthOrchard" placeholder="which type of trees grows best in the NORTH garden? Which type of trees grows worst?"></textarea>
      <p>
      </p>

      <textarea rows="8" cols="40" id="userSouthOrchard" placeholder="which type of trees grows best in the SOUTH garden? Which type of trees grows worst?" ></textarea>

      <p> Once you have done this, hit the "Submit Answer" button and we'll proceed with 15 minutes of the arrangement task.</p>
