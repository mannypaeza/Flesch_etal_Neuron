### NOTES
assignments of trees to sessions is determined for each participant. 
this generates a unique file with tree ids which has to be imported to the ptb scripts for phase 4 and 5
this guarantees that trees are trial-unique (no overlap in exemplar distributions between different phases, and assignment randomised across subjects)

#### phase_1: short training (3.3min)
25 tree levels * 1 exemplar * 2 contexts = 50 trials. INTERLEAVED
50 trials * 4s / 60 = 3.3 min

#### phase_2: first test phase  (13.3min)
25 tree levels * 4 exemplars * 2 contexts = 200 trials. INTERLEAVED
200 trials * 4s / 60 = 13.3 min

#### phase_3: main training (60min, breaks every 15min)
25 tree levels * 18 exemplars * 2 contexts = 900 trials. (225 per block, have task switch after 450 trials) BLOCKED/INTERLEAVED
900 trials * 4s / 60 = 60 min

#### phase 4 granada: mini refresher
25 tree levels * 1 exemplar * 2 contexts = 50 trials. BLOCKED
50 trials * 4s / 60 = 3.3 min
#### phase 5 granada: scanning session
25 tree levels * 12 exemplars * 2 contexts = 600 trials INTERLEAVED
600 trials * 6.5s / 60 = 65 min
